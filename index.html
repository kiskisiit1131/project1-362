          <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The IIT Reboots are a co-ed outreach based a cappella group that volunteers to perform around the city of Chicago at places like 
            retirement homes or children's hospitals. I strongly believe that music is powerful enough to brighten someone's day and it has been 
            scientifically proven to have a variety of positive effects on people's brains. You don't need to have a background in music 
            to be in this group, just a huge passion for it and preferably a good ear (although any past musical experience is a huge plus). 
            If you love music and want to brighten the Chicago community one song at a time, then consider auditioning for the IIT Reboots!</p>

          <h2>Auditions</h2>
            <p>Auditions will be super simple. All you need to do is prepare 30 seconds of any song of your choice; it helps to pick a song that shows 
            off your range. If you are a beatboxer, please prepare a few beats that showcase your skills.
            Also, you'll need to learn the Star Spangled Banner in the key of your choice (I promise you won't need to sing the whole song for the audition). 
            Don't panic, I'll give you the starting note if you need it!
            You can pick whichever order you want to do this in, whether you want to sing your song/beatbox or the Star Spangled Banner first.
            It takes a lot of courage to sing in front of people, but conquering that fear is so important. Confidence is key, especially
            for a group like this where we will be singing to groups of people at a time. I will email information to anyone that's on the email list
            about audition dates for the fall semester once the days are finalized.</p>

          <h2>Rehearsals and Performances</h2>
            <p>Rehearsals will be one day during the week during the IIT lunch hour which is 12:50 PM - 1:45 PM. 
            Performances will be on Sundays, either morning or early to mid-afternoon. When the fall semester approaches, I will have decided on a 
            concrete rehearsal day and have performance days finalized as well. 
            I will send out emails to anyone that's on the email list with details on locations, transportation, times, 
            and any other pertinent information in regards to rehearsals and performances.</p>
